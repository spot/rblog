=Description=
I originally wrote rblog for use on my personal site. When I dediced to redo the majority of the application
I figured I would go ahead and release the source and make it my very first project. I'm hoping that others will find
this and make it their own. I encourage you to branch off and maybe add on to it or even improve it. So enjoy and I'll keep
trying to improve it.
